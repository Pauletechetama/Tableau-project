# Co2 Emission Data Visualization

# About the project

The dataset used in this analysis contains CO2 emission of different regions in diferrent countries and different years. In this data analysis project, i have explored the cleaned Co2 emission dataset and used Tableau to create my visualizations. This is a data visualization project to manifest the power of data visualization in the process of understanding and exploring data

# Dataset
The cleaned Co2 dataset contains 6 fields which includes Country name, Region, Year, Country code and others, with 11127 rows of Co2 emission across different regions in different countries and different years. This dataset can be found on below links.

# Description
In my Tableau story i have done exploration on the goegraphic data, string data and numeric data. i created a simple visualization in which co2 emission are displayed by country. I loaded the data in the workspace, explored and went further to create a visualization. In sheet1 i created a chart that displays Co2 emission by country by loading the country name data into the field as that is what i will be working with,this displayed a map of countries on the planet with dots indicating which countries are represented in the data and went further to include a measure which is the CO2(kt). That was to scale each country by Co2 emission thereby changing the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of co2 emitted. I went further to spice up the coloring a bit by changing the color of the emission, this was done by simply dragging the measure to the color label box.

# Summary
From the visialization The united States emits the largest amount of Co2 followed by China, Japan and Russia. This can be clearly seen due the measure introduced in the chart. In the link below you can view the data visualzation.
